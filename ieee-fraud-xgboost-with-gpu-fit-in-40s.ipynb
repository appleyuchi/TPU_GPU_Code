    "# About this kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I get started, I just wanted to say: huge props to Inversion! The official starter kernel is **AWESOME**; it's so simple, clean, straightforward, and pragmatic. It certainly saved me a lot of time wrangling with data, so that I can directly start tuning my models (real data scientists will call me lazy, but hey I'm an engineer I just want my stuff to work).\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed two tiny problems with it:\n",
    "* It takes a lot of RAM to run, which means that if you are using a GPU, it might crash as you try to fill missing values.\n",
    "* It takes a while to run (roughly 3500 seconds, which is more than an hour; again, I'm a lazy guy and I don't like waiting).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this kernel, I bring some small changes:\n",
    "* Decrease RAM usage, so that it won't crash when you change it to GPU. I simply changed when we are deleting unused variables.\n",
    "* Decrease **running time from ~3500s to ~40s** (yes, that's almost 90x faster), at the cost of a slight decrease in score. This is done by adding a single argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, my changes are super minimal (cause Inversion's kernel was already so awesome), but I hope it will save you some time and trouble (so that you can start working on cool stuff).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changelog\n",
    "\n",
    "**V4**\n",
    "* Change some wording\n",
    "* Prints XGBoost version\n",
    "* Add random state to XGB for reproducibility"
